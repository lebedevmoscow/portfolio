Playing around with Next

This is the basic Portfolio page with custom forum, posts, auth system and so on.
All is writen on Next + React on Frontend, backend is actually using Node + Express

I'm think future is for Next and SSR, so I'd think it would be nite idea to practice with that and create something relatively big

After all, as a communication with server and client via api I'm decide to use a Graphql as a lighten and more performance version of api. Maybe it's not a correct choise as this app is not highload, but why not to try something new right?
